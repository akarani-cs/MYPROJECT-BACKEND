# MYPROJECT-BACKEND
This is my ALX project back end


i'll use django and django rest framework.

This API is a Django REST Framework (DRF) project that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) reviews for movies. It also includes user management with authentication and permissions. The API demonstrates backend development skills in database design, authentication, authorization, search, filtering, and deployment.
